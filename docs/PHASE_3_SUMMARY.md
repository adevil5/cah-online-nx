# Phase 3 Summary: Move Backend Logic to Supabase

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Phase 3 successfully migrated all backend logic from NestJS to Supabase Edge Functions and PostgreSQL database functions. The frontend now communicates directly with Supabase instead of the NestJS backend.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Supabase Edge Functions Created

All core game logic has been moved to Supabase Edge Functions:

- **create-game** (`supabase/functions/create-game/index.ts`)
  - Generates unique game code
  - Creates game session
  - Adds host as first player
  - Returns game details

- **join-game** (`supabase/functions/join-game/index.ts`)
  - Validates game code
  - Adds player to game session
  - Broadcasts player joined event
  - Returns game details

- **start-game** (`supabase/functions/start-game/index.ts`)
  - Validates host permission
  - Updates game state to in_progress
  - Creates first round
  - Selects random Card Czar
  - Deals random black card
  - Broadcasts game started event

- **deal-cards** (`supabase/functions/deal-cards/index.ts`)
  - Deals white cards to players
  - Shuffles card deck
  - Tracks cards per player (default 10)
  - Broadcasts cards dealt event

- **submit-response** (`supabase/functions/submit-response/index.ts`)
  - Validates player is not Card Czar
  - Validates card ownership
  - Creates response with selected cards
  - Marks cards as played
  - Checks if all players submitted
  - Moves to judging phase when ready
  - Broadcasts response submitted event

- **judge-winner** (`supabase/functions/judge-winner/index.ts`)
  - Validates Card Czar permission
  - Updates round with winning response
  - Calculates player scores
  - Checks if game should end
  - Creates next round or ends game
  - Broadcasts winner selected event

### 2. Shared Edge Function Utilities

Created shared utilities in `supabase/functions/_shared/`:

- **cors.ts** - CORS headers for all functions
- **supabase-client.ts** - Client creation helpers
- **response-helpers.ts** - Standardized response formatting

### 3. PostgreSQL Database Functions

Created database functions for common operations (`supabase/migrations/20251020213725_add_database_functions_and_rls.sql`):

- `get_player_hand(game_id, user_id)` - Get player's unplayed cards
- `get_game_state(game_id)` - Get complete game state with players and current round
- `get_round_responses(round_id)` - Get all responses for judging
- `get_player_scores(game_id)` - Get win counts for all players
- `can_join_game(game_code, user_id)` - Check if user can join a game

### 4. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

Implemented comprehensive RLS policies to replace NestJS AuthGuards:

**Game Sessions:**
- Players can view games they're in
- Authenticated users can create games
- Only host can update game settings

**Player Sessions:**
- Players can view other players in their games
- Players can join games

**Rounds:**
- Players can view rounds in their games
- Only Edge Functions can create/update rounds

**Responses & Response Cards:**
- Players can view responses in their games
- Players can create their own responses
- Players can add cards to their own responses

**Game Cards:**
- Players can only view their own cards
- Only Edge Functions can deal cards
- Players can update their own cards

**Cards & Decks:**
- All users (including anonymous) can view cards and decks

**Players:**
- Players can view their own profile
- Players can view other players in their games
- Players can create/update their own profile

### 5. Frontend Services

Created new services to replace HTTP client calls:

**SupabaseService** (`apps/frontend/src/app/services/supabase.service.ts`):
- Authentication (signUp, signIn, signOut)
- Edge Function calls (createGame, joinGame, startGame, dealCards, submitResponse, judgeWinner)
- Database queries (getPlayerHand, getGameState, getRoundResponses, getPlayerScores)
- Direct table access helpers
- Realtime channel creation

**GameRealtimeService** (`apps/frontend/src/app/services/game-realtime.service.ts`):
- WebSocket channel management
- Event listening (player-joined, game-started, cards-dealt, response-submitted, winner-selected, next-round-started)
- Broadcast messaging
- Table change listeners

### 6. Frontend Store Updates

Updated NgRx SignalStores to use Supabase instead of HTTP:

**AuthStore** (`apps/frontend/src/app/store/auth/auth.store.ts`):
- Uses SupabaseService for register, login, logout
- Handles Supabase auth responses
- Converts Supabase user/session to app models

**GameStore** (`apps/frontend/src/app/store/game/game.store.ts`):
- Uses SupabaseService for createGame, joinGame, startGame
- Fetches players from Supabase
- Uses database functions for game state

### 7. Environment Configuration

Created environment files with Supabase configuration:

- `apps/frontend/src/environments/environment.ts` - Local development (localhost:54321)
- `apps/frontend/src/environments/environment.prod.ts` - Production (to be configured)

## Architecture Changes

### Before Phase 3
```
Frontend (Angular) → HTTP → NestJS Backend → Supabase Database
```

### After Phase 3
```
Frontend (Angular) → Supabase Client → Supabase Platform
                                       ├── Edge Functions
                                       ├── PostgreSQL + RLS
                                       └── Realtime Channels
```

## Security Improvements

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Database-level access control replaces application-level guards
2. **Supabase Auth** - Industry-standard authentication instead of custom JWT
3. **Service Role** - Edge Functions use service role for privileged operations
4. **CORS Configuration** - Proper CORS headers on all Edge Functions

## Real-time Capabilities

All game events now broadcast via Supabase Realtime:
- Player joined/left
- Game started
- Cards dealt
- Response submitted
- Winner selected
- Next round started

## Migration Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity** - No backend server to maintain
2. **Better Scalability** - Supabase handles scaling automatically
3. **Free Tier Friendly** - All features work within Supabase free tier limits
4. **Real-time Built-in** - Native WebSocket support
5. **Type Safety** - Generated types from Supabase schema
6. **Developer Experience** - Simpler local development setup

## What's Next: Phase 4

Phase 4 will remove the NestJS backend entirely:
- Remove backend and backend-e2e apps
- Remove NestJS dependencies
- Update CI/CD configuration
- Clean up project structure

## Testing Recommendations

Before proceeding to Phase 4, test the following:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Sign up new user
   - Sign in existing user
   - Sign out
   - Session persistence

2. **Game Flow**
   - Create game
   - Join game (multiple players)
   - Start game
   - Deal cards
   - Submit responses
   - Judge winner
   - Multiple rounds
   - Game completion

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Player joins game (other players see update)
   - Game starts (all players notified)
   - Responses submitted (Card Czar sees update)
   - Winner selected (all players see results)

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Invalid game code
   - Non-host trying to start game
   - Card Czar trying to submit response
   - Invalid card selections
   - Network disconnections

## Known Issues / Future Improvements

1. **Type Generation** - Need to generate TypeScript types from Supabase schema
2. **Error Handling** - Could add more detailed error messages
3. **Rate Limiting** - Consider adding rate limiting to Edge Functions
4. **Validation** - Add more input validation in Edge Functions
5. **Testing** - Add unit tests for Edge Functions
6. **Monitoring** - Set up logging and error tracking

## Notes

- All Edge Functions use TypeScript/Deno runtime
- RLS policies are comprehensive but may need refinement based on testing
- Game realtime service uses broadcast for instant updates
- Auth state is managed via Supabase session
- Database functions use SECURITY DEFINER for privileged access

**Phase 3 Complete!** Ready to proceed to Phase 4: Remove NestJS Backend.
